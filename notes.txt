Stacking context
highest z-index appears first

CSS Architecture, components and bem

think > build > architect mindset

think
  component driven design
    modular building blocks to make interfaces
    held together by the layout of the page
    reusable acroos a project and between projects
    should be independent (do not depend its parent element)


build
  bem: block element modified
    .block__element--modifier
      block: standalone component
      element: part of a block that has no standalone meaning
      modifier: different version og a block or an element

architect
  smacs
  logical file and folder structure
  7-1 pattern
    7 different folders for partial sass files
      base
      components
      layout
      pages
      themes
      abstracts
      vendors
    1 main sass file to import partial
    a compiled css stylesheet

sass, css preprocessor
  variables, reusable values
  nesting, nest selectors
  operator for mathematical operations
  partial and imports to write in different files and importing them into one single
  mixins to write reusable pieces of css code
  functions, similar to mixins to produce a values
  extends: to make seelctors inherit common declarations (reuse code)
  control directive: writing complex code using conditionals and loops (more used for css frameworks)

  uses two sintaxes
    sass
    scss (sassy sass), is more used

Responsive
  fluid layout
    allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width
    use % (or vh[view height]/vw[view width]) unit instead px
    use max-width instead of width
  responsive units
    use rem instead px
    help to scale the layout automatically
  flexible images
    images do not scale in automated way as we change the viewport
    so we need to use % for image dimensions with max-width property
  media queries
    changes css styles on certain viewport widts

  Which types of layouts exists
    [in 1st exercise] > float: old way of building, using float css property
    [in 2dn exercise] > flexbox: use a 1-dimensional row without using floats, useful for component layouts
    [in 3rd exercise] > css used for 2-dimensional rows

  utility classes

Responsive design
  strategies
    desktop-first
      start writing css for the desktop/large screens
      then use media queries to shrink design to smaller screens
    mobile-first
      start writing css for mobile devices
      inverse strategy than first one
      force us to reduce websites to the absolute essentials
      pros
        optimized for mobile
        focused on abosulte essentials
        result in smaller products
        prioritizes content over aesthetic
      cons
        desktop version feels empty and simplistic
        more difficult to develop
        clients are used to see dektop version of site
      think about what is the purpose of your website
  max-width and min
    media queires do not add any importance or specificity to selectors
    to solve any issue related to that, put them at the end
  breakpoints
    bad way
      develop for a specific set of devices
      no futuer proof
    good way
      group devices in a logical way and set your breakpoints based on them
    perfect way
      ignore devices, focus on content
      you start at the smaller break and when contents displays wrongly, start working on a new break
  responsive images
    use cases
      resolution switching: decrease image resolution in smaller screen
      density switching: decrease phisical pixels in the image
      art direction: different image for a smaller screen
  other points
    Does not exists hover on touch devices (could be obvious, but is good to remember it)
    dpi: Dots per inch, a resolution messurament more used in Apple devices (retina display)

Flexbox
  Module of css3
  gives the container the ability to expand and shrink elements to best use all available space
  concepts
    items, the elements
    container, the box around ints elements
